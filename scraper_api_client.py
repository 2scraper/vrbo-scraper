"""vrbo-scraper — 2captcha Scraper API edition (fourth engine)

One HTTP request per page, no local browser, no Playwright install. The
2captcha Scraper API fetches the page from its own infrastructure and returns
the HTML; this client parses it with the same `product_parser` the browser
engines use, so the rows and columns are identical.

WHAT IT CAN AND CANNOT GET HERE — AND THIS IS NOT MEASURED
-----------------------------------------------------------
Be warned before you spend anything: **this path was not verified against
Vrbo.** The 2captcha key available while this repo was written returned
`ERROR_KEY_DOES_NOT_EXIST`, so every request answered HTTP 401 and the data
path is untested. What WAS verified is the failure handling — the key is
never printed, the endpoint's credentials are masked, and the run exits 5.

What to EXPECT when you do try it, from what is measured about the site:

  * A Vrbo search page carries its grid over client-side POSTs to
    `/graphql`. The first HTML response is a shell with **no cards in it** —
    0 `application/ld+json` blocks, 0 `__NEXT_DATA__`, and an
    `__APOLLO_STATE__` holding three keys. So a browserless fetch that does
    not RENDER will parse zero rows, and `--wait-element` is not optional
    here, it is the whole job:

        --wait-element '[data-stid="lodging-card-responsive"]'

  * Even rendered, expect a PARTIAL page. First paint is 3 to 18 of 50
    cards, and the rest arrive only by scrolling an inner container — which
    a one-shot fetch cannot do. A browser engine is the honest way to get a
    whole page.

So reach for this when you want a cheap look at what is at the top of a
search — and use a browser engine when you want the page.
